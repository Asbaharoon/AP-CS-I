# Problem 1 - Concatenating Fractions
Here is a partial `Fraction` class.

Implement `getNumerator` and `getDenominator`. Then fill in the toString method so that it returns a Fraction in the form “numerator/denominator”, such as “1/2” or “16/20”.

## 
Test your `toString` method using `main`.

In main, create a `Fraction` that represents 1/2.

Then you should ask the user for the numerator and denominator for another `Fraction`. Create a new `Fraction` object to represent the user’s fraction so you can print it out later.

Compute the fractions’ sum (in `main`) as follows
```
a/b + c/d = (a*d + b*c)/(b*d)
```
You can store the results of the sum in another `Fraction` object.

Print out the equation and the answer using the objects. Note you do not have to call `toString` on the objects explictly.

Your output should look something like
```
Enter the numerator: 
2
Enter the denominator: 
3
1/2 + 2/3 = 7/6
```
