Over the course of the year students will collaboratively and independently design, develop and implement functional and responsive web pages using these foundational skills. 

Additional Fundamental topics in this course include the design of solutions to problems, the use of data structures to organize large sets of data, the development and implementation of algorithms to process data and discover new information, the analysis of potential solutions, and the ethical and social implications of computing systems. The course emphasizes object-oriented programming and design using the Java programming language, along with how to interact with robots and devices.
