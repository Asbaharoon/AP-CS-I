# Problem 1 -  : Number Games
This class has a few methods for manipulating a number.

The object has been created for you. Call the methods indicated and print out the result of each method call.

Your output should look like this
```
6.0
36.0
72.0
72.0
```

# Problem 2 - Construction Costs
The `Construction` class is completed for you, but you may want to look at it to make sure you understand how to use it.

Then write a program in the `main` method that asks the user to enter the sales tax rate as a decimal, the number of boards needed, and the number of windows needed.

Create a `Construction` object to compute the cost of the lumber and windows. Use $8 for the cost of lumber. Use $11 for the cost of windows.

Print the total cost. Then use the method to compute the tax and print out the grand total including tax.

Here is an example of the output
```
Enter the sales tax rate: 
.08
How many boards do you need? 
10
How many windows do you need? 
5
Total: 135.0
Grand Total: 145.8
