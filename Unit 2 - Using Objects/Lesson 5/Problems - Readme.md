# Example: Moving a Point
This is an example for this lesson. You are encouraged to play around with it, run and change the code, and learn how it works. When you are done, click continue to go to the next problem.

# Problem 1 - Using the Point Class
In this program we are going to have you practice using the Point class.

Weâ€™ve already created a Point object at `(10, 5)`, printed it out, and moved it.

First, try to run this program. Then, create your own Point at the position `(2, 4)` and print it out.

Then move your new point 5 units in the x direction and 2 units in the y direction. Finally, print out the point again to see that it moved.

# Problem 2 - Chat Bot 2.0
In this exercise, we are going to extend our Chat Bot that we created earlier. Chat Bot 2.0 still has all the same commands as before, but we have added a few new methods to expand his conversation.

Your Task:
- Check out the Bot2 class to make sure you understand the names and inputs for the new methods
- Ask the user for information and call the Bot2 method that corresponds to that reply
- You will need to ask for name, favorite animal, where they live, and favorite number.
- Include a greeting after the user introduces themselves, and a goodbye to end the conversation.
When you are finished, your output should be similar to the conversation below, although your answers may vary.
